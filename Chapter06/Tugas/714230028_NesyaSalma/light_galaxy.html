                        A galaxy is a vast, gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas,
                        dust, and dark matter that exists in space. Galaxies come in various shapes and sizes, and they
                        are the building blocks of the universe. They are the largest structures in the cosmos and can
                        contain billions to trillions of stars.

                                Galaxies are primarily composed of stars. These stars are bound together by gravity and
                                orbit a common center of mass within the galaxy.

                                dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. These objects are the remnants of stars that
                                have gone through their life cycles.

                                new stars. The gas consists mainly of hydrogen and helium, while dust particles can
                                consist of various elements and compounds.

                                GA significant portion of a galaxy's mass is believed to be dark matter, which does not
                                emit, absorb, or reflect light and is detected through its gravitational influence on
                                visible matter. Dark matter helps to explain the observed gravitational dynamics within
                                galaxies.

                                Galaxies come in different shapes and structures. The three main types are spiral
                                galaxies (such as the Milky Way), which have a flattened, rotating disk with spiral
                                arms; elliptical galaxies, which are more spherical or ellipsoidal in shape; and
                                irregular galaxies, which lack a distinct, regular shape.
